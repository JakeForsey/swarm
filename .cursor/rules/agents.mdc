- Agents modules (in `swarm/agents`) must implement: `def act(state: State, team: int, key: jax.random.PRNGKey) -> tuple[jnp.ndarray, jnp.ndarray]:`
- Agents should be concise, simple, performant
- Prefer not using comments (add them only where really required)
- Prefer not using doc strings (add them only in an agents act function)
- These agents should only be a small handful of functions
- A good example of an agent is [simple.py](mdc:swarm/agents/simple.py)
- You can find the current agents rewards in [README.md](mdc:README.md) if you want to study well perfoming agents
